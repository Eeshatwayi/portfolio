        <p>
          This project presents a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to uncover business insights
          and optimize sales strategies. Data was cleaned and aggregated using <strong>SQL</strong>, and
          key performance indicators (KPIs) were visualized using <strong>Power BI</strong> for better
          decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong> SQL queries were used to calculate core KPIs — Total Revenue, Average Order Value,
          Total Pizzas Sold, and Total Orders.  
          <br />
          <strong>Step 2:</strong> The dataset was then visualized in Power BI, showing patterns like
          order trends by day and month, category-based performance, and revenue by pizza size.
        </p>
